🌀 Maze Quest - A 2D Maze Adventure
Welcome to Maze Quest, a thrilling 2D maze game where your wits, patience, and sense of direction will be put to the ultimate test! Built using the powerful Godot Engine, this game is all about solving intricate mazes while collecting hidden treasures and avoiding tricky traps.

🌟 Overview
In Maze Quest, your goal is simple: navigate from the maze entrance to the exit while picking up as many objects as possible along the way. Sounds easy, right? Well, get ready for some twists and turns! Each maze is procedurally generated, so no two runs are ever the same. The deeper you go, the harder it gets!

Simple yet challenging gameplay: Easy to pick up, tough to master.
Pickups and power-ups: Grab them as you go to boost your score and abilities.
Traps and obstacles: Watch out for hidden dangers that may cost you time and progress.
